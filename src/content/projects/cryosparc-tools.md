# cryosparc-tools

While working at [Structura Biotechnology](https://structura.bio/), I designed
and released cryosparc-tools, an open-source Python package that enables
scripting access to [CryoSPARC](https://cryosparc.com/), a <abbr
title="Cryogenic Electron Microscopy">cryo-EM</abbr> software package.
