# Linkify

Linkify is an open-source JavaScript library that I created and have been
maintaining since 2013. Use Linkify to find links in plain-text and convert them
to HTML &lt;a&gt; tags. It automatically highlights URLs, #hashtags, @mentions
and more.

Learn more at [linkify.js.org](https://linkify.js.org). Linkify's source code is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/Hypercontext/linkifyjs).
